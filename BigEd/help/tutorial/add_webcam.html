<p>The first step in configuring any AR experience with the editor involves specifying the webcam
to be used. Once a web-cam is physically attached to the computer hosting the runtime, and as long
as it has been registered with JMF, then this webcam will appear automatically in the <code>Possible
Things</code> panel, as shown below:</p>

<p>To make use of the web-cam:</p>
<ol>
	<li>drag-and-drop it into the ARTECT Editor pane, at which point an icon will appear
	representing the webcam</li>
	<li>indicate that you intend to use this webcam with the runtime by making a visual connection
	between these two icons
	<ol>
		<li>move the cursor over either one of the icons</li>
		<li>hold down the left mouse button</li>
		<li>drag the cursor over the other icon</li>
		<li>release the left mouse button</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting configuration should look as shown below and as a result of it, the <code>3D Output</code> window
is launched, which displays the video view from the camera. In general, these types of connection
between icons are the primary mechanism used in ARTECT to configure relationships between resources.
Such connections are also used for various other configuration tasks, and they are always created
through the same mechanism.</p>
