<p>Once the web-cam has been connected to the runtime, you can begin to configure the
associations between markers and 3D models that will allow any markers recognized in the video feed
produced by this web-cam to be augmented with 3D models. This involves two tasks:</p>
<ol>
	<li>selecting the markers to use</li>
	<li>selecting the 3D models to appear on these markers</li>
</ol>
To select the markers to use:
<ol>
	<li>expand the <code>AR markers</code> entry in the <code>Possible Things</code> panel,
	revealing a list of markers (labelled "marker A", "marker B", "marker C", "marker D", etc.)</li>
	<li>choose two of these markers, and drag-and-drop them into the <code>ARTECT Editor</code>
	panel, thereby creating an icon that looks like the marker</li>
	<li>add a connection between each marker icon and the web-cam</li>
</ol>
At this point, the ARTECT editor should look as shown below:
<img src="images/IMGAR008.png" />

<p>Each of these markers can now be configured with a 3D model. To make this configuration:</p>
<ul>
	<li>expand the 3D Objects entry in the Possible Things panel</li>
	<li>Drag-and-drop the cello 3D model into the ARTECT Editor panel</li>
	<li>add a connection between the icon representing the model and the icon representing the
	marker</li>
</ul>
At this point, the ARTECT editor should look as shown below:
<img src="images/IMGAR009.png" />
<p>This configuration can now be tested by placing a physical print-out of both of these markers
in the field of view of the webcam. The physical version of the marker connected to the cello should
be augmented, in the video feed displayed in the <code>3D output</code> window, with a 3D model of a cello (see
the image below), whilst the physical version of the other marker should produce no augmentation.<img src="images/IMGAR010.png" /></p>
