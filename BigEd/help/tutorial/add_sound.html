<p>The ARTECT editor can be used to associate a sound sample with either a marker or a 3D model.
If associated with a marker, then the sound sample will play whenever the marker becomes visible in
the associated webcam, regardless of whether there is a 3D model connected to that marker. If a
sound is associated with a 3D model, then it will play only when that 3D model becomes visible -
i.e. whenever a marker which has been associated with that 3D model is visible in the webcam. In
both cases, the sound sample will only play once, and will fade out if the relevant marker is moved
outside of the filed of view of the webcam.</p>
To associate a sound with a 3D model:
<ol>
	<li>expand the <code>Sounds</code> section of the <code>Possible Things</code> panel</li>
	<li>drag-and-drop the cello sound sample into the <code>ARTECT Editor</code> panel</li>
	<li>create a connection between the cello sample icon and the icon representing the cello
	model</li>
</ol>
At this point, the ARTECT editor should look as shown below:

<p>Now whenever you place the <code>Hiro</code> marker in webcam view, you will see the 3D model of a cello and
hear the sound of a cello playing.</p>
