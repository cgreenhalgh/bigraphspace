<title>ARTECT Install Notes</title>
</head>
<body>

<b>Required</b>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.java.com/">Java 1.5 or higher</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html">Java
	Media Framework 2.1</a> (JMF)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check to see if Java and JMF are installed by going to Add or Remove Programs in the
Control Panel. Java will appear in the list as either J2SE 5.0 Runtime Environment Update 14 or
Java(TM) 6 Update 7, or similar. JMF will appear as Java Media Framework 2.1.1e. Java Media
Framework 2.1.1e will also appear in the start menu.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: In Windows Vista and some versions of Windows XP, Microsoft's Java is not
installed. Although ARTECT doesn't use Microsoft's Java, the Jave Media Framework uses the Java
directory that is created by Microsoft's Java to store configuration information, and if this
directory is missing then ARTECT will not be able to find any webcams. To fix, create a Java
directory under C:/Windows (or the appropriate windows directory if it is elsewhere) before
installing JMF.</p>

<b>Installation</b>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~ktg/artect-editor-installer.exe">Download the ARTECT
	Editor Installer</a></li>
	<li>Run the installer</li>
	<li>Select an install directory. Make sure you have permission to write to the location you
	try to install to, or you will receive an error like "Error opening file for writing: C:\Program
	Files\ARTECT\.eclipseproduct".</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~ktg/artect-components-installer.exe">Download the ARTECT
	Components Installer</a></li>
	<li>Run that installer</li>
	<li>Select the same installation directory as for the ARTECT Editor.</li>		
</ul>

<b>Configuring a Webcam</b>
<p>Before running ARTECT, you need to configure your webcams in the Java Media Framework (JMF).
You'll need to do this any time you use a new webcam.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Connect the webcam</li>
	<li>Start JMF Registry, this can be found in the start menu, under Java Media Framework
	2.1.1e. The start menu link might not work, in which case it can be started from C:\Program
	Files\JMF2.1.1e\bin\jmfregistry.exe</li>
	<li>In the JMF Registry, select the 'Capture Devices' tab.</li>
	<li>Click the 'Detect Capture Devices' button. The JMF Registry will spend a several minutes
	detecting what capture devices you have installed, and their capabilities.</li>
	<li>Click 'Commit' to save the detected web cams.</li>
	<li>You can now close the JMF Registry, and you should be able to use your web cam in ARTECT.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should now be able to use ARTECT. Go to the directory you installed it to and run
artect.exe to start it. A tutorial is available from within ARTECT. Just select Help Contents on the
Help menu in order to find it.</p>
