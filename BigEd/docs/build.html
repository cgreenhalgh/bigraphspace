<title>BigEd Build Notes</title>

<p>The BigEd plugin is design to allow editing of Bigraphs. Currently it supports 
the editing of bigraph xml files. It is still early in the development of BigEd, 
and many features are missing or not working. Use at your own risk. Development is 
ongoing though, and hopefully you'll be able to see the potential of BigEd.</p>
