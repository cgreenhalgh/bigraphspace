<h1>Release Notes - ReactiveXML/Bigraphs</h1>




Chris Greenhalgh<br>




<h2>Known issues</h2>




<ul>




  <li>The&nbsp;abstraction for Match is massively incomplete, and there
is no abstract access to&nbsp;Matcher/Transformer (c.f. Bigraph vs
DomBigraph)</li>

  <li>Matcher
(and Bigraph/Place) does not distinguish between support names and
support variable names - needed to match to allow matching to specific
individuals.</li>




  <li>There is currently no support in the Definitions XML or the code
to specify that a rule applies only if the context of the match is
(transitively) active.&nbsp;</li>




  <li>BigraphFinder has only a single &nbsp;global default - should allow (e.g. class-loader specific default for use in simulator)</li>




  <li>DomReactiveBigraph has some placeholder fields but doesn't actually support creation as a sub-bigraph.</li>




  <li>RuleCondition evaluation does not do active test.</li><li>Control index matching in the DomMatcher is by string equality,
so will not be correct if string representation is not normalised for
type.</li>
  <li>DomMatch variable values are all strings.</li>
  <li>Not all bigraph variable methods are currently implemented (in the programmatic manipulation parts of the API).</li>
  <li>(related) The VariableDefinition and VariableConstraint classes
should become interfaces with DomBigraph and signature.xml/standalone
implementations.</li>
  <li>Control and support-type bigraph variables are not currently implemented/supported.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible enhancements</h2>



<ul>



  <li>Some ReactionRule conditions would be easier to specify if
multiple conditions/redex could share link value binding constraints,
i.e. value bindings. For example it would be easier to say (in effect)
provided that this particular X is not already known... (perhaps
preconditions after the redex using that match as a basis)</li>




</ul>




<h2>Changes</h2>
2009-07-29<br>
<ul>
  <li>support for control indexes in DomTransformer; implement difference constraint; update tutorial accordingly.</li><li>changes to term parser for site [] and add indexed controls (both forms)</li>
</ul>
2009-07-28<br>

<ul>

  <li>initial (partial) implementation of control and bigraph
expressions, i.e. rewrite of control indexes, add bigraph variables and
initial support in matching. </li>

</ul>

2009-07-02<br>

<ul>

  <li>fixed (?!) DomMatcher bug with
root match found outside another root match; add support for root/site
match to DomMatcher to support Placings </li>

</ul>

2009-07-01<br>


<ul>


  <li>fixed DomMatcher to keep edges (non-outer names) in pattern disjoint.</li>


</ul>


2009-06-29<br>



<ul>



  <li>Pulled link match up to Match abstraction from DomMatch.</li>



  <li>Made transform copy unbound link values by default where a
support match exists between redex and reactum (allows more concise
signature-independent rules) </li>



</ul>



2009-06-26<br>




<ul>




  <li>Defining ReactiveBigraph API; implementing initial version (sync.
API); implementation of initial change callbacks and rule execution;
rule_test</li>




  <li>Starting point of abstracted Match interface.</li>




</ul>




2009-06-25<br>




<ul>




  <li>Match and transform (rule application) both working at least to
a first approximation in the Dom-based version (only - no abstraction
layer).</li>




</ul>
