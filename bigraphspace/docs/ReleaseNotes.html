<h1>Release Notes - ReactiveXML/Bigraphs</h1>
Chris Greenhalgh<br>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The&nbsp;abstraction for Match is massively incomplete, and there
is no abstract access to&nbsp;Matcher/Transformer (c.f. Bigraph vs
DomBigraph)</li>
  <li>There is currently no support in the Definitions XML or the code
to specify that a rule applies only if the context of the match is
(transitively) active.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>BigraphFinder has only a single &nbsp;global default - should allow (e.g. class-loader specific default for use in simulator)</li>
  <li>DomReactiveBigraph has some placeholder fields but doesn't actually support creation as a sub-bigraph.</li>
  <li>RuleCondition evaluation does not do active test.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Changes</h2>
2009-06-26<br>
<ul>
  <li>Defining ReactiveBigraph API; implementing initial version (sync.
API); implementation of initial change callbacks and rule execution;
rule_test</li>
  <li>Starting point of abstracted Match interface.</li>
</ul>
2009-06-25<br>
<ul>
  <li>Match and transform (rule application) both working at least to a first approximation in the Dom-based version (only - no abstraction layer).</li>
</ul>
