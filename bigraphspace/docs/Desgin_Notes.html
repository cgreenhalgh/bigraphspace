<h1>Design Notes</h1>



Chris Greenhalgh, 2009-06-17; last updated 2009-06-24<br>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p class="MsoPlainText">To get myself going my initial
thoughts are to focus on
representation(s) as a starting point, in particular both language-type
(concise) representations and 2D graphical representations, and
scaffolding
their two-way translation to/from the XML representation of the
bigraph(s).</p>



<p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p></o:p>In the
first instance my inclination is to mostly ignore
interfaces and try to explore how these (and sortings/disciplines in
general)
can be layered on top of the basic model. As far as I can see, most of
the subtlety
in the first instance is around handling attribute values (i.e. links),
and in
the second round it is in constraining rule matching correctly.</p>



<p>So I'll start by assuming that the XML model will be standard
(Java) DOM.</p>



<p>Package reactivexml.model will be utilities for working with
this
"raw" format, e.g. wrappers for read/write, built-in element names.</p>



<p>Package reacticexml.parser will be a (hopefully generalisable)
parser/renderer for working with programming language views of the
bigraphs (and vice versa).</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Initially there is (a
version of) the
bigraph term language - for basic modelling and reaction rules; and
(approximately) a subset of the mini-ML in Elsborg's thesis (but using
Standard ML syntax for some parts and others bits currently omitted).</p>



<p>Package reactivexml.gui will be 2D GUI support/views for the
core model.</p>



<p> Package reactivexml.sorting will be for sortings and
signatures.</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The basic elements of a
signature/sorting
are: (the set of sorts) the sort of each control, the arity (no. of
ports) of each control (in the XML encoding extended to the name of
each port), whether each control (sort??) is atomic, the activity of
each control (active or passive (if not atomic), a.k.a. status), a
formation rule - a property which is satisfied by well-formed bigraphs
of this sorting&nbsp; "by the identities and symmetries and
preserved
by composition and product" [Milner, 2009, p.59].</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">In a well-formed sorting the
formation
rule corresponds to a decomposable predicate - which is never false for
a sub-bigraph if it can be true of the composition of that bigraph with
another. </p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Each root and hole also has
a sort
(interface sort), and typically the formation rule will determine this
from&nbsp; node sorts. </p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">There are some special sorts
which are
infinite sets of controls, e.g. corresponding to the natural numbers,
or the points in a cartesian space.</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Typically, the visual
rendering of a node is also keyed to its control (and perhaps sort).</p>



<h2>Future directions</h2>



<p>A bigraph workbench? E.g. based on Eclipse. Allowing modeling,
simulation, authoring, development.</p>



<p>A bigraph programming language, i.e. a programming language
"fitted"
to working with bigraphs, e.g. manipulating and responding to
bigraphical representations (like ML type constructor [=control] and
record [=node]?) and reaction rules (including creating its own
reaction rules).</p>



<p>A bigraph-based distributed infrastructure, for creating
ubicomp
systems, using the above, which are therefore more amenable to
analysis, etc. E.g. a bigraph equivalent of LIME for coordination? plus
a bigraphical programming language for behaviour? plus the workbench
for authoring, etc.?</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">How would this differ from
EQUIP or Linda?</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">First, in the "things" in
the dataspace,
i.e. bigraph(s) rather than tuple (approx. atomic nodes only) or
objects (approx. bigraphs but without explicit links and with no
support for changing fields, etc.).</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Second, in that the
dataspace(s) are themselves bigraph places/nodes, and might be
manipulated as such.</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Third, in that the
pattern(s) used would naturally correspond to the redex of a bigraph
rule.</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Fourth, in the the
operations admitted on
the dataspace might include the full range of "primitive" bigraph
manipulations (e.g. movement, link formation), not just in/out (place
introduction and removal).</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">As well as the basic
(non-distributed) model, one or more approaches to distribution would
also need to be supported. E.g. the
system is constructed using one or more shared long-lived remotely
accessible bigraph-spaces (c.f. LINDA, EQUIP2
client/server),&nbsp;the system is constructed using one or more
shared long-lived
transparently distributed bigraph-spaces (c.f.&nbsp;Limbo, EQUIP),
multiple
bigraph-spaces are (termporarily) brought together as a transparently
distributed entity (c.f. LIME), multiple bigraph-spaces are
linked/briged by application-level agents (c.f. Limbo, EQUIP2).</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">How would you implement it
(efficiently)?? E.g. partial updates, history, indexing/query
performance, link following and link-based rules?</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">How do you actually realise
link-preservation/tracking across process bounaries? E.g. distributed
naming service(s), GUID(s), ...?</p>



<p>The same implementation could then form the basis of the
workbench :-) </p>



<p>What are the options/issues of using the XML mapping of
bigraphs?</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The mapping is simple and
the XML form is quite understandable and intuitive (typically more so
than the bigraphical form as expressed in the usual presentations at
least to developers familiary with XML). This mapping and the
intuitions it leads to may be useful irrespective of the actual
realisation.</p>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">It is possible to leverage
XML technologies to support the implementation of the system.
Particular options include:</p>



<ul>



  
  
  <ul>



    <li>Standard XML facilities could be used in the
implementation, e.g. DOM, SAX, marshalling, unmarshalling, XSLT.</li>



    <li>The XML encoding might be used for inter-process
communication of bigraphs and bigraph fragments.</li>



    <li>An XML database might be used to realise
bigraph(s),&nbsp;within the design tool and/or within the run-time
system (c.f. EQUIP2 J2EE's use of Hibernate as the underlying
implementation of the dataspace API).</li>



    <li>An existing/standard XML database protocol might be used
to interactive with the bigraph model, e.g. XPath, XQuery, XML:DB
XUpdate.</li>



    <li>The signature and/or sorting might be mapped to a
corresponding XML Schema, allowing XML-schema tooling to be exploited,
e.g. the XML encoding of a bigraph to be edited in a schema-driven
editor, or to use development tool support to help in programming
against such models (e.g. JAXB for object binding).</li>



    <li>XML ID/IDREF might be used to directly model
DAG-structured place-graphs. (But note that ID should not be used for
support as one XML document might contain multiple bigraphs (e.g. a
reaction rule) each of which might contain nodes with the same support)</li>



    <li>Aside from the XML mapping of bigraphs we can use XML in
other places and exploit XML technologies, e.g. the signature file
format and the use of JAXB for reading/writing it.</li>



  
  
  </ul>



</ul>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;">However, the correspondence is not absolute, and there are
some complexities to consider:</p>



<ul>


  
  
  <ul>



    <li>The queries expressed by (e.g.) XPath are not the same as
those expressed by bigraph matching; some mapping would be required. </li>



    <li>There are some additional semantics not native to XML, e.g.
holes and roots. </li>



    <li>Order of children is not generally significant in bigraphs,
but can be in XML, and care has to be taken to correctly abstract this.
    </li>



    <li>The notion of linking as expressed in the encoding has no
direct correspondence in XML, consequently care must be taken e.g. when
moving and copying bigraph fragments, to do the "right thing" with
linking. For example, this might require renaming (i.e. rewriting
specific attribute values).</li>



    <li>Different XML technologies and implementations have their
own general context(s) and paradigms of use, which may or may not fit
well. E.g. update behaviour, transaction support, history support.</li>



    <li>Only some strings are valid as XML element names or XML
attribute names; in general control and port names might not respect
these constraints.</li>



    <li>If string constants are encoded directly as
identically-named links to a corresponding node then some string
constants will not be valid as XML attribute value(s). Some constant
link renaming would be required.</li>



    <li>XML has a reputation for inefficiency, and support for XML
is patchy on small devices (e.g. mobile phones, J2ME). Various other
low-level semi-structured encodings are also used/suggested as
alternatives, e.g. JSON.&nbsp;</li>



  
  
  </ul>


</ul>



<p style="margin-left: 40px;" 40px="">Should we add an abstraction
layer, and make the use of XML (or
whatever) an internal implementation detail? This is my current
inclination.</p>



<h2>

Matching</h2>

I matching of a redex is (i think):<br>

<ul>

  <li>a one-to-one mapping from nodes in the redex (pattern) to nodes in the bigraph&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
which in turn implies:
<ul>

  <li>a one-to-zero-or-more mapping from sites in the redex to nodes in the bigraph</li>

  <li>a one-to-one mapping from roots in the redex to roots or nodes in the bigraph</li>

  <li>a one-to-one mapping from link names in the redex to link names in the bigraph, which is identity for constant link names</li>

</ul>

such that:<br>

<ul>

  <li>for each node in the pattern, the control of the bigraph node
is the same as the control of the redex node&nbsp;(the redex control
may be parameterised, in which case the mapping binds a value to the
pattern control parameter);</li>

  <li>if two nodes (or a node and site) in the pattern are parent/child then this is true of the corresponding nodes in the bigraph</li>

  <li>if two nodes (or a node and a site or two sites) in the pattern
are juxtoposed (sublings) then the same is true of the corresponding
nodes in the bigraph.</li>

  <li>the nodes mapped to in the bigraph by a a site in the pattern are siblings</li>

  <li>if a node in the pattern maps to a node in the bigraph then all
of the children of the node in the bigraph are in the image of the
children of the pattern node (i.e. none are missed out - remember sites
can "soak up" any number of nodes in the mapping)</li>

  <li>each constant link name in the pattern maps to exactly the same constant link name in the bigraph</li>

  <li>the ports on a node in the pattern map to the identically named ports on the corresponding node in the bigraph</li>

  <li>every port in the bigraph has a link value equal to the mapping of the link value of the corresponding port in the pattern </li>

  <li>a port in the pattern which is explicitly unconnected maps to
an unconnected port in the bigraph or to a port with a non-constrant
link name that has no other occurance in the bigraph</li>
  <li>an edge (non-outer name) in the pattern maps to a non-constant link in the target which does not occur in the context</li>
  <li>an
edge (non-outer name) in the pattern maps to a non-constant link in the
target that is not mapped to any other link in the pattern&nbsp; </li>

  <li>a pattern root which is identified as "active" is only considered
to&nbsp;matches a root or a node in the bigraph&nbsp;which is active
and all of whose ancestors are active</li>

  <li>no node in the bigraph is mapped to by more than one node, root or site in the pattern</li>

</ul><h2>Predicates and Logic</h2><p>Conforti, Macedonio and Sassone
propose BiLog, a spatial logic for bigraphs, which they show
generalises various other spatial logics. There are various places
where it would be useful to have predicates over bigraphs, for example
to express sortings of bigraphs and to express more precise conditions
on reactions. So I will try using BiLog for this, or least some
fragment of it.</p><p>BiLog has a notion of selective "transparency"
whereby certain constructors (e.g. controls) can be hidden with respect
to the logic, allowing a class of selective generalisation. For now I
will not consider this aspect of BiLog.</p><h3>BiLog Formulae</h3><p>The formulae of BiLog are built on:</p><ul><li>constant
formulae corresponding to the primitive constructors of bigraphs, and
which are satisfied exactly by the corresponding bigraphs:</li><ul><li>C<sub style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">x</sub> (written with an arrow over the x), which is a node of control C with ports linked to the names in <span style="font-style: italic;">x</span> (which has ordered elements corresponding exactly to the number of ports). This has the (usual) signature 1 -&gt; &lt;1, X&gt;.</li><li>1,&nbsp;the empty root, with the (usual) signature 0-&gt;1.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">join</span>, with signature 2-&gt;1, the merging of (the contents of) two roots into one root.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">swap</span><sub>m,n</sub>, m+n -&gt; n+m, the exchange in order of the first m roots with the remaining n roots.</li><li>/a, signature {a}-&gt;{}, the closure of a (which removes a from the outer face).</li><li><sup>a</sup>/<sub>X</sub>,
signature X -&gt; {a}, substituion (which associates the names in the
set X in the inner face with the name a in the outer face).</li><li>a, which is short-hand for <sup>a</sup>/, {}-&gt;{a} </li></ul><li>id<sub>I</sub>, which is the identity on the interface I and therefore matches that interface.</li><li>F, false, which is not satisfied by any bigraph, and&nbsp;T, true, which <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> satisfied by any bigraph.</li></ul><p>BiLog respects the axioms of bigraphs, for example equivalence under renaming and the non-significance of node order.</p><p>The main operators of bigraphs have BiLog equivalents:</p><ul><li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">tensor-product</span> B, which is satisfied if the bigraph can be decomposed into G' <span style="font-style: italic;">tensor-product</span> G'' where G' satisfies A and G'' satisfies B. Note that tensor-product strictly requires name distinct in G' and G''.&nbsp;</li><li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">compose</span> B, which is satisfied if the bigraph can be
decomposed into G' <span style="font-style: italic;">compose</span> G'' where G' satisfies A and G''
satisfies B.</li></ul>BiLog does not include the derived parallel composition operations (|
or ||) because these are (apparently) undecidable as they range over
the infinite set of names. However it does provide the following approximation:<ul><li>A  <span style="font-style: italic;">separation-up-to</span>
B, written as a name vector above tensor-product, which is an explicit
name-sharing parallel composition. It is satisfied if G = some G' ||
G'', where G' satisfies A and G'' satisfies B and the only names shared
between G' and G'' are in the name vector. &nbsp;</li></ul>BiLog includes common and classical operators:<br><ul><li>A =&gt; B, satistified if every bigraph satisfying A also satisfies B.</li><li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> B, (logical conjunction) satisfied if both A and B are satisfied.</li><li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">or</span> B, (logical disjunction), satisfied if A or B (or both) is satisfied.</li><li><span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> A, satisfied if A is not satisfied.</li><li>A &lt;= B, reverse implication, B =&gt; A.</li><li>A &lt;=&gt; B, two-way implication, A =&gt; B <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> B =&gt; A.</li></ul>BiLog
includes "adjuncts" of tensor-product and composition (category
theorists like adjoints but I still don't understand them properly):<br><ul><li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">left-compose-adjunct</span> B, written o-, which is satisfied if for all G' satisying A and G' compose G defined, G' compose G satisfies B.</li><li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">right-compose-adjunct</span> B, written -o, which is satisfied if for all G' satisying A and G compose G' defined, G compose G' satisfies B.</li><li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">left-tensor-product-adjunct</span> B, written <span style="font-style: italic;">tensor-product</span>-, which is satisfied if for all G' satisfying A and G' tensor-product G defined, G' tensor-product G satisfies B.</li><li>A <span style="font-style: italic;">right-tensor-product-adjunct</span> B, written <span style="font-style: italic;">-tensor-product</span>, which is satisfied if for all G' satisfying A and G tensor-product G' defined, G tensor-product G' satisfies B.</li></ul>From these many more operators are derived:<br><ul><li>A<sub>I</sub> = A o id<sub>I</sub>, i.e. the bigraph satisfies A and has inner face I.</li><li>A<sub>-&gt;J</sub> = id<sub>J</sub> o A, i.e. the bigraph satisfies A and has outer face J.</li><li>A<sub>I-&gt;J</sub> = id<sub>J</sub> o A o id<sub>I</sub>, i.e. the bigraph satisfies A and has signature I -&gt; J.</li><li>A o<sub>I</sub> B = A o id<sub>I</sub>&nbsp;o
B, i.e. there is a decomposition into a bigraph satisfying A and a
&nbsp;bigraph satisfying B which has interface I at the composition
point.</li><li>dual of tensor product = not ( not A tensor-product not
B ), i.e. for all horizontal subdivisions, the left satisfies A or the
right satisfies B</li><li>dual of composition = not ( not A compose not
B ), i.e. for all vertical subdivisions, the context satisfies A or the
parameter satisfies B</li><li>... (more for adjunts) ...</li><li>some horizontal term satisfies A (existential quantification on tensor product) = T tensor-product A tensor-product T.</li><li>every
horizontal term satisfies A (universial quantification on tensor
product) = not ( T tensor-product not A tensor-product T )</li><li>some vertical term satisfies A (existential qualification on composition) = T compose A compose T</li><li>every vertical term satisfies A (universal qualification on composition) = not ( T compose not A compose T )</li><li>somewhere A (on ground terms) = (T o A)<sub>unit</sub>. (the empty interface)</li><li>anywhere A (on ground terms) = not (somewhere not A)</li></ul><h3>Attempted Examples</h3><p>Let's try homomorphic place sorting...</p><p>C<sub>X</sub> - some control, interface 1 -&gt; &lt;1,X&gt;, so has no internal names, so cannot have any links into it.</p><p>C<sub>X</sub> o 1 =&nbsp;C<sub>X</sub> o<sub>1</sub> 1 - empty C control, 0 -&gt; &lt;1,X&gt;</p><p>C<sub>X</sub> o T =&nbsp;C<sub>X</sub> o<sub>1</sub> T - C control containing anything with outerface 1, i.e. no out names</p><p>( C<sub>X</sub> separation-up-to-X' id<sub>X'</sub>
) o T where X subset of X', signature &lt;1,X'&gt; -&gt; ? - a control
C containing a bigraph which may share names in X' (which includes
ports of C)</p><p>Note that we may choose only to consider bigraphs
with names drawn from X', so that separation-up-to-X' is effectively ||
(wide parallel composition).</p><p>T o ( C<sub>X</sub> separation-up-to-X' id<sub>X'</sub> ) o T&nbsp; where X subset of X' -&nbsp;some bigraph containing a C<sub>X</sub> which in turn contains anything and which may share names in X' (including all ports of C)</p><p>( P<sub>X</sub> separation-up-to-X' id<sub>&lt;X'&gt;</sub> ) o join ( &nbsp;C<sub>Y</sub> separation-up-to-X' id<sub>&lt;1,X'&gt;</sub>
) o T where X,Y subsets of X' - a node P containg a node C (implicitly
containing a site) and a site, passing all names including ports of P
and C, to an arbitrary parameter with two roots (one being placed in C,
the other directly into P).</p><p>T o ditto - a bigraph in which the above occurs anywhere (need not be ground).</p><p>( C1<sub>Y1</sub> or C2<sub>Y2</sub> or ... ) - Control C1 (with port names Y1) or control C2 (with port names Y2) or ...</p><p>T o ( ( PX separation-up-to-X' id<sub>X'</sub> ) o T =&gt; not ( ( PX separation-up-to-X' id<sub>X'</sub> ) o join ( ( C1<sub>Y1</sub> or C2<sub>Y2 </sub>or ...) separation-up-to-X' id<sub>&lt;1,X'&gt;</sub> ) o T ) - every sub-bigraph by composition, if it starts with a P does not have a C1, C2, ... as a child.</p>There are various rewriting of this expression which allow the negation to be moved around. <br><h3>Initial reflections</h3><p>This seems rather unwieldy and not very intuitive. Some reasons for this seem to include:</p><ul><li>having
to allow linking explicitly in order to express that you don't care
about it (rather than as a default). (identities are not transparent)</li><li>the
principled avoidance of | and ||, requiring explicit name sets and
explicit joins. Perhaps effective correspondents could be defined using
separation-up-to?&nbsp;</li><li>not using some of the possible derived
expressions, partly because they are hard to write, and partly because
they are not quite what we want, e.g. "somewhere" using
separation-up-to rather than tensor-product, and/or not limited to
ground terms. Presumably we should just define the varants we want.</li><li>not
being used to writing/thinking like this, e.g. expecting to have
variables to range over nodes and express further things about those
nodes (e.g. for every node n of control C, c is a child of n implies
that the control of c is C1, C2 or C3). Perhaps I'll get used to it, or
perhaps other notations can be translated?</li></ul>
