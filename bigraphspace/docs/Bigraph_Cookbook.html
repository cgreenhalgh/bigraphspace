<h2>General Principles and Heuristics</h2>

<h3>Containment vs Linking</h3>

<p>The place graph component of bigraphs is less expressive than the
link graph component. It's structure is simpler and "apparent". So one
rule of thumb is: use the place graph whenever it is sufficiently
expressive, and only use the link graph if that fails.</p>

<p>This is comparable to the object/entity modelling choice of
composition vs&nbsp;association. Composition (part of) relationships
typically imply fate sharing, e.g. common life-cycle. This is also true
in bigraphs: children of a node in a parameter get moved around, copied
or deleted together with their parent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>See for example records and tuples (below).</p>

<h3>One Ports vs Multiple Ports vs Inner Nodes</h3>

<p>A link connects any number of ports from any number of controls and
is undirected. Consequently links between multiple ports have limitted
expressiveness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a link is directed then this can usually be expressed by
splitting each port into two: one "outbound" port and one "inbound"
port.</p>

<p>If a port may be linked to from several other ports then there is no
way to associate information with any one peer port in particular. For
example consider a web server with one "server" port to which many
browsers are connected; there is no place for information at the server
end about an individual client. In such cases the single shared port on
the parent control can be replaced (in modelling or perhaps even by a
reaction) with a dedicate port on each of a set of new child
controls.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img style="width: 633px; height: 314px;" alt="shared ports and subcontrols" src="images/shared_ports_and_subcontrols.PNG"></p>

<h2>Numbers and Other Simple Datatypes</h2>
<h3>Numbers&nbsp;</h3>

<h4>Numbers as a Set of Controls</h4>

<p>Numbers (and other values) can be represented as instances from a (potentially infinite) set of controls, e.g. (0 and 1):</p>

<pre>	N_0 | N_1 | ...<br></pre>

<p><img style="width: 279px; height: 103px;" alt="numbers as controls" src="images/numbers_as_controls.PNG"></p>

<p>If these controls are atomic and have arity 0 (no ports) then
"having a value" can only be modelled by placing such a control in a
"meaningful" site.</p>

<p>This approach requires that the system support parameterised
(families of) controls. It also suggests that reaction rules should be
able to express such families and/or constrained subsets of them, e.g.
"any number", or "any number between 5 and 10". </p>

<h4>Numbers as Peano Numerals</h4>

<p>There is an obvious&nbsp;encoding of natural numbers using controls
(data constructors) Succ (with one site) and Zero (which is atomic):</p>

<pre>	Zero | Succ(Zero) | Succ(Succ(Zero)) | ...<br><img style="width: 523px; height: 231px;" alt="peano numerals" src="images/peano_numerals.PNG"><br></pre>

<p>Depending on the context, this might be substituted for the previous approach (numbers as a family of controls).</p>

<h4>Numbers as Constant Links</h4>

<p>Work at ITU-C on ReactiveXML (e.g.
Hildebrandt and Winther, 2005) proposes the use of "constant" links to
model numbers (and other constants such as strings). These correspond
effectively to a set of "globally" accessible and constant outer
names&nbsp;which represent these values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So a Record with field "x" equal to "1" might be modelled as:</p>

<pre>	Record { x="1" }</pre>

<img style="width: 363px; height: 278px;" alt="number as constant link" src="images/number_as_constant_link.PNG">
<p>To ground this approach in the theory of bigraphs the constant link
may optionally be considered to be linked to a unique node that
represents the corresponding value (using one of the previous
representations):</p>
<p><img style="width: 572px; height: 274px;" alt="numbers as constant link 2" src="images/number_as_constant_link2.PNG"></p>
<p>This
modelling approach gives a concise XML representation, and leaves open
the door to changing the actual node(s) representing the number (or
other constant) at the other end of the link.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However it complicates the link graph and requires
additional assumptions and constraints in the model, such as the
constancy of these links, and the presence of the assumed context
within thich they are found and defined. It also logically depends on
one of the other number encodings to give the links their meaning.</p>

<p>This approach also suggests that reaction rules should be
able to express constrained subsets of such constant links for ports, e.g.
"(links corresponding to) any number", or "(links corresponding to) any number between 5 and 10". </p>

<h3>Other Simple Values</h3>

<p>The same approaches can be used for other types of values as for numbers (above). Some examples are given below.</p>

<p>In general, a data constructor can typically be modelled as a corresponding control.
If it depends on multiple sub-values then these can distinguished as
for fields in records (below) by means of dedicated child controls.</p>

<h4>True and False</h4>

<p>The obvious control-based model is two atomic controls:</p>

<pre>	True | False<br><img style="width: 242px; height: 110px;" alt="true false" src="images/true_false.PNG"></pre>

<h3>Records and Tuples</h3>

<p>There are two main strategies, as for numbers: place-based and link-based. </p>

<h4>Records with Fields as Places</h4>

Milner (2009), p.64, shows how controls can modelled with arbitrary
rank, i.e. distinguished subsites. This approach can be used to model
Records with Fields, e.g. as in the previous example:<br>

<pre>	Record( x( N_1 ) )<br><img style="width: 256px; height: 233px;" alt="field as place" src="images/record_field_as_place.PNG"></pre>

<p>Note that a new set of controls (including "x") has been introduced
to model the fields; the child(ren) of that control are the value(s)
associated with that field.</p>

<p>This modelling approach avoids the use of links entirely (assuming
that values are copies) and ensures that values are copied/deleted with
containing fields or records within the parameter of a reaction.</p>

<h4>Tuples as Records with Standard Field Names</h4>

<p>Tuples can be modelled as records (see above) using a standard set
of ordered field "names", e.g. "_1", "_2", ... (compare the similar
properties used in RDF to model the elements of a collection). For example, using the place modelling the tuple (1,2):</p>

<pre>	Tuple( _1( N_1 ) | _2( N_2 ) )<br><img style="width: 469px; height: 224px;" alt="tuple" src="images/tuple.PNG"><br></pre>

<p>Tuples of different length could&nbsp;have distinct controls (which should give more expressiveness), e.g.</p>

<pre>	Tuple_2( _1( N_1 ) | _2( N_2 ) )<br><img style="width: 442px; height: 232px;" alt="fixed size tuple" src="images/fixed_size_tuple.PNG"><br></pre>

<h4>Records with Fields as Ports</h4>

If values are modelled as constant
links (above), it is natural to model records as controls and fields as
ports. Reproducing the example, above, a Record with field "x" equal to
"1" might be modelled as:
<pre>	Record { x="1" }</pre>

<img style="width: 363px; height: 278px;" alt="number as constant link" src="images/number_as_constant_link.PNG">
<p>This
modelling approach gives a concise XML representation.&nbsp;However
it complicates the link graph and requires
additional assumptions and constraints in the model, such as the
constancy of these links, and the presence of the assumed context
within thich they are found and defined. It also generalises less well
to other kinds of values, since they must all be linked to and their
life-cycle and consistency maintained independently of the Record.</p>

<h2>State</h2>
<p>The state of an element of a system can modelled in a number of different ways.</p>
<h3>State as a Token</h3>
<p>A
common description of finite state machines and petri nets is in terms
of states as places which can hold a token representing their
activation. E.g.</p>
<pre>	StateA{l1=a} ( Token ) | StateB{l1=a} ( ) <br><img style="width: 357px; height: 138px;" alt="state as token" src="images/state_as_token.PNG"><br></pre>
<p>For each site this approach is limited to states corresponding to&nbsp;boolean or (small) counts. </p>
<h3>State as a&nbsp;Field-like Value</h3>
<p>A more flexible representation of state uses one of the record/field models, described above.&nbsp;</p>
<pre>	Car( speed( N_10 ) | ignition( True ) )<br><img style="width: 464px; height: 231px;" alt="" src="images/state_as_fields.PNG"><br></pre>
<p>Another example of this is can be seen in the model of object position as an internal value (below).</p>
<h3>State as a Control Set</h3>
<p>State
can be modelled by a change of control. This has the additional benefit
that the state can affect the ports and sorting of the node, for
example a network device having a "connection" port only in an active state.</p>
<pre>	InterfaceDown{}( ) | InterfaceUp{connection=c1}( )<br><br><img style="width: 448px; height: 217px;" alt="" src="images/state_as_control_set.PNG"><br></pre>
<p>Milner
(2009) uses this approach (without varying ports) when modelling petri
nets (p.67), and also (2009b)&nbsp;with varying ports when modelling
the savannah game. </p>
<h3>State as a Link</h3>
<p>Mainly for completeness, we note that the presence or absence of a link may indicate a&nbsp;state. </p>
<h2>Digital resources</h2>
<h3>Database</h3>
<h4>Relational Database</h4>
<p>A
database may be modelled as a place.&nbsp;It may not be necessary to
model the database itself if the rows and/or tables will not be
confused without it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Each table may be modelled as a place. In this case each table might
be identified by a unique control, a field-like name (in a child place
or port) or a distinguishing link.&nbsp;Alternatively
the table can be omitted from the model and each row of the table
suitably distinguished from rows of other tables.</p>
<p>Each row can be
modelled as a record (see above), either with a nested node for each
column holding its value or a port for each column linking to its value
or perhaps both (see below). If tables are not modelled explicitly then
each row needs to indicate its table, e.g. by a table-specific row
control.</p>
<p><img style="width: 640px; height: 444px;" alt="" src="images/database.PNG"><br>
</p>
<p>A bigraph match can model a join if&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) there are links between equal values,  for example if the constant link modelling approach is used for numbers&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="width: 697px; height: 307px;" alt="" src="images/join_constant_link.PNG"></p>
<p>or if additional explicit links are added for this purpose&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="width: 696px; height: 369px;" alt="" src="images/join_extra_link.PNG"></p>
<p>or
(b) the control expression language supports control variables and
existential quantification allowing the set of patterns with equal
values (modelled as control sets) to be expressed directly.</p>
e.g.
<p><img style="width: 697px; height: 366px;" alt="" src="images/join_no_link.PNG"></p>
<p>with match expression:</p>
<p><img style="width: 698px; height: 342px;" alt="" src="images/join_no_link_expression.PNG"></p>
<h4>Object Database (todo)</h4>
<p>Object composition can be modelled by containment. Object reference can be modelled by linking.</p>
<p>Inheritance and/or interface compatibility and sub-typing require some further thought/design, perhaps mainly in the sorting.</p>
<h4>Tuple-space</h4>
<p>It is straight-forward to model a tuple-space as a place containing tuples (modelled as above).</p>
<p><img style="width: 521px; height: 373px;" alt="" src="images/tuplespace.PNG">&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Media (linked to deployment) (todo)</h3>
<p>The mention of deployment highlights the wish to integrate this with
the actual files in terms of authoring and then deploying to a
particular device. I.e. the thing(s) modelled are also actually present
and manipulatable within the tool/development system, and this should
be integrated. </p>
<h2>Space</h2>
<h3>Topology</h3>
<h4>Topology as Ports and Links</h4>
<p>If
there is a fixed and finite set of possible "directions" (or
equivalent) by which places may be linked then "directions" can be
modelled as ports and connectedness by links, e.g.</p>
<pre>	Square{east=s1e}() | Square(west=s1e,east=s2e}() | Square{west=s2e}<br><img style="width: 425px; height: 155px;" alt="" src="images/topology_as_ports.PNG"><br></pre>
<p>This approach is used by&nbsp;Søren and Damgaard (2005) when modelling the game of life.</p>
<h4>Topology as Child-nodes and Links</h4>
<p>If there is not fixed set of "directions" then the elaboration of
ports to child nodes can be used to model a more general topology, e.g.</p>
<pre>	Locale( anchor{link=l1} ) | Locale( anchor{link=l1} | anchor{link=l2} ) | Locale( anchor{link=l2} )<br><img style="width: 386px; height: 124px;" alt="" src="images/topology_as_child_nodes.PNG"><br></pre>
<p>This
approach is used by Milner (2009b) modelling the locales in the
savannah game, and by Krivine, Milner and Troina (2008) when modelling
cell membrane budding. </p>
<h3>Overlap</h3>
<p>In the standard model of bigraphs the place graph is a forest
(ordered set of trees), and each non-root place has exactly one parent.
Consequently overlapping of places cannot be directly modelled in the
place graph.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be desirable to model overlap e.g. in physical space
(overlapping radio signals, or signals overlapping physical
object(s),buildings subdivided into floors with rooms but with some
high "rooms" spanning multiple floors
) or in multi-dimensional classifications (e.g.&nbsp;the same object
organised into both physical and policital or organisational
classifications).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Extending the Bigraph Model to DAGs</h4>
<p>Michele <span style="" lang="EN-US">Sevegnani (University of
Glasgow) has been using bigraphs to model element of 802.11 wireless
protocols, and has been extending the model (and algebra) to
place-graphs which are directed acyclic graphs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="" lang="EN-US">The key extension is that a site may be
the child of two or more places. The existence of a node (or nodes)
which is the child of two (or more) parent nodes is taken
to&nbsp;precisely represent the overlap of those parent places. In
particular, if two places have no common child (or descendent?) then
they are considered not to overlap.</span></p>
<p><span style="" lang="EN-US"><img style="width: 221px; height: 166px;" alt="" src="images/overlap.PNG">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="" lang="EN-US">The graphical rendering of bigraphs is
complicated by extension, since not all valid place graphs can be shown
in the 2D box view. A new "stratified" graphical representation is
proposed to resolve this in a general way (all be it with a loss of
intuitive expression).</span></p>
<p><span style="" lang="EN-US">This extension also complicates reaction
rules, in that they must now distinguish between copying a root of the
parameter and placing it in the (perhaps new) overlap of its parents in
the reactum.</span></p>
<p><span style="" lang="EN-US">Basic place sortings are presumably also complicated by this extension. </span></p>
<p><span style="" lang="EN-US">More detail is currently beyond the scope of this cook-book.</span></p>
<h4><span style="" lang="EN-US">Using Links to Model Additional Hierarchies&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p>The hierarchical containment relationship of place graphs can
modelled as a "parent" port on every control and a "child" port on
every non-atomic control, and child nodes linked to their parent node
by linking the child node's parent port to the parent node's child
port.&nbsp;</p>
<img style="width: 586px; height: 332px;" alt="" src="images/hierarchy_links.PNG"><br>
<p>Note that the non-containment of (link-modelled) children means that
children are (in general) not composed with their parents, and so
parametric reaction rules which move, copy or delete sites do not
automatically move, copy or delete (respectively) the (link-modelled) "child" nodes.</p>
<p>However any number of additional hierarchies can modelled by the
addition of hierarchy-specific parent and child ports and links.</p>
<p>This seems like a plausible approach for modelling some abstract
"overlay" classifications in which fate-sharing may be less relevant. </p>
<h4>Using Links to Model Directed&nbsp;Graphs</h4>
The above strategy cannot be used to model directed graphs (or equivalently multiple parents), for example:<br>
<img style="width: 521px; height: 253px;" alt="" src="images/overlap_not_hierarchy.PNG"><br>
<p>Note that there is only one edge that links A, B and D to C and E,
i.e. it models C and E both being children of all of A, B and D.</p>
<p>To cope with this at least one of the ports needs to be converted to
a child node to maintain the separation of edges to (or from) a node
(either is sufficient). For example:</p>
<p><img style="width: 519px; height: 258px;" alt="" src="images/overlap_parent_links.PNG"></p>
<p>Note that, as with the encoding of hierarchy, there is no
containment and therefore no composition or default fate sharing
between places and thenodes (nominally) in their overlap. </p>
<h4> Modelling Overlap by "Intersection" Nodes</h4>
<p>The extension of place-graphs to DAGs suggest an approach to
modelling overlap by an explicit modelling of the intersection as a
distinct sibling place:</p>
<img style="width: 233px; height: 162px;" alt="" src="images/overlap_discrete.PNG">
<p>In addition this requires that the containment of AB within both A
and B be modelled. This cannot be done by as the hierarchy case (above)
because this would lose the distinction between AB as a child of A and
B and (say) AD, a separate child of A and D. This can be resolved by
elaborating the "parent" node port to a child node:</p>
<img style="width: 235px; height: 225px;" alt="" src="images/overlap_discrete_linked.PNG">
<p>This is effectively a refinement of the previous approach, which
groups children of intersections into maximal sets, modelled as new
places. At least within these new intersection places there is
composition and default fate sharing (movement, copying, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can also be viewed as the node AB "labelling" the link between A and B.</p>
<p>This could be further elaborated to the child-node and link representation
of topology (above), although there would need to be two different
child nodes controls in order to distinguish the direction of
containment (AB within A and B, not vice versa). It is not clear to me
what if any benefit this further elaboration would give.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Modelling "Weak" or Asymmetric Overlap</h4>
<p>If the overlapping places are strongly asymmetric then the previous
scheme may be weakened to (effectively) merge the intersection with the
"dominant" parent, leaving the overlap with the other parent to be
modelled by a link. The overlap may still be modelled as a distinct sub-place:</p><p><img style="width: 239px; height: 211px;" alt="" src="images/overlap_discrete_dominant_linked.PNG"></p><p>or the link may be directly to the nodes in the overlap:</p>
<img style="width: 236px; height: 160px;" alt="" src="images/overlap_dominant_linked.PNG">
<p>Essentially, the node(s) in the overlap are "labelled" with a link to (an anchor in) the other "parent(s)"/regions. </p>
<h3>Cartesian Space</h3>

<p>Modelling a cartesian space requires (a) modelling coordinates and
(b) modelling the relationship between the coordinates and the space
which they measure and (c) modelling the relationship between the
objects in the space and their coordinates (and/or each other). These
are considered in turn.</p>

<h4>Coordinates as Records</h4>

A single coordinate can be modelled as a record or tuple (see above), e.g. "12,10":<br>

<pre>	Coordinate( x( N_12 ) | y( N_10 ) ) <br></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>	Coordinate( _1( N_12 ) | _2( N_10 ) ) )</pre>

<h4>Coordinates as a Set of Controls</h4>

<p>A single coordinate can be modelled as a control from a (parameterised) set of coordinate controls, e.g. "12,10":</p>

<pre>	Coordinate_12_10<br></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>	[12,10]<br></pre>

<p>The latter assumes a richer range of textual representations for parameterised controls.</p>

<h4>Coordinates Independent from the Space</h4>

<p>The coordinates may be independent of the space (control) that they describe (see later examples).</p>

<h4>Coordinates Within the Space</h4>

The coordinates may made children of the space that they describe. This
approach is suggested by Milner's initial modelling of the Savannah
game (Milner, 2009b), e.g. a spatial "locale" spanning part of a
coordinate system (coordinate controls are written in this example as
"[xy]"):<br>

<pre>	locale( [1,4] | [2,4] | [3,4] | [2,5] | [3,5] )</pre>

<img style="width: 236px; height: 195px;" alt="savannah locale" src="images/savannah_locale.PNG"><br>

<p>This has the benefit of making clear which coordinates fall within each parent space.</p>

<p>Note that the visual position of the coordinate controls within the
locale is irrelevant to the bigraphical representation, but probably
important for most visualisations. This implies that a graphical
bigraph viewer/editor might have locally specific layout methods for
particular kinds of models and modelling approaches.</p>

<h4>Object Position as an "Internal" Value</h4>

<p>The modelled object may be augmented with an internal control such
as "Position" which contains the representation of its coordinate, e.g.:</p>

<pre>	Person( Position( [12,10] ) | ... )</pre>

Typically this implies that the coordinates are independent from the
space, because for the normal tree-based place graphs this would
otherwise prevent the representation of two objects at the same
coordinates or overlapping (only one could be the parent of each
coordinate).<br>

<h4>Object Position as Linked Value</h4>

<p>The modelled object may be augmented with a port that links to the representation of its coordinate, e.g.</p>

<pre>	Person{ position=p } | [12,10]{position=p}</pre>

<img style="width: 259px; height: 178px;" alt="position linked" src="images/position_linked.PNG"><br>

Typically this implies that the coordinates within space approach is
being used: the resort to linking then allows multiple objects to share
the same position, while the links are likely to be (reasonably) local.
This is the approach suggested in Milner (2009b):<br>

<img style="width: 330px; height: 297px;" alt="position linked local" src="images/position_linked_local.PNG"><br>

<p>This approach could be combined with coordinates independent of
space, but would it this case the "internal value" approach would
probably be preferred.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Signals over Space</h3>
<p>Unguided (free space) radio and optical communication is very
common. Radio waves in particular have complex propagation
characteristics, passing through different materials to different
extend, being reflected and refracted and experiencing interference
(self- and other-). However they are also clearly spatially organised:
it is natural to talk about regions of coverage, line of sight is often
significant, and signal strength generally falls with distance.&nbsp;</p><h4>Signal Coverage as Containment</h4><p>One approach is model the coverage or maximum range of the signal - a (typical closed) region - directly by a node. A device control within the signal control is then considered to be in range.</p><p>However,
if there are multiple near-by signals, and/or if other features of the
physical setting are also be modelled (such as buildings and rooms)
then this approach tends to require that signals overlap each other and
parts of the modelled environment. For example C might be a device, and
A and B proximate signals, or A a signal and B a room:</p><p><span style="" lang="EN-US"><img style="width: 221px; height: 166px;" alt="" src="images/overlap.PNG"></span></p>
<p>Various approaches to modelling overlap can then be used - see sections above. For example, as noted above Michele <span style="" lang="EN-US">Sevegnani
(University of Glasgow) is extending place graphs to DAGs, allowing
overlap to be modelled directly in the place graph, specifically in order to model overlapping signals.</span></p><p><span style="" lang="EN-US">This approach has the merit of making the place-fulness of signals very explicit.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="" lang="EN-US">However
containment of a device within a signal does not correspond to the
usual "part-of" or "contained-in" relationship that the place graph
typically models. For example, movement of the signal source will
result in movement of the signal, but this does not normally result in
movement of any devices receiving the signal. Nor do such devices (or
other "in range" entities) normally fate-share with the signal (e.g. if
the signal is deleted, i.e. turned off, then they are not).</span></p><p><span style="" lang="EN-US">This
suggests that signal overlap may be seen as a "weaker" relationship,
and (in terms of overlap) an assymetric model may be more appropriate
(if less intuitive).</span></p><h4>Signal Strength as Containment</h4><p>An extension of the previous approach models discrete levels of signal strength by nested nodes.&nbsp;</p><img style="width: 232px; height: 274px;" alt="" src="images/signal_levels.PNG"><p>This
approach has the merit of making the place-fulness of signals very
explicit, but also has the same issues as the previous one in relation
to overlap and (non-) fate sharing.</p><h4>Signal Receipt as Linking</h4><p>A
device being in range of a signal may be modelled by a link. If we
assume that a device might be in range of several signals
simultaneously then at least one end of this link will need to be a
child node rather than a port (or a port will be needed for every
signal, or the devices in range of different signals will become
conflated).&nbsp;</p><p><img style="width: 847px; height: 169px;" alt="" src="images/signal_link.PNG"></p><p>It
is useful to have an internal node rather than a port in any case if
that end of the link needs to have explicit or additional information
about the link. So, for example, a beacon signal would be most
naturally modelled in the second way, since the device wants to "know"
about the signal, but the not vice versa.</p><p>Clearly, this approach
doesn't provide any obvious support for expressing the coverage: the
rules must somehow create and destroy link(s) appropriately (but see
extensions, below).</p><h4>Signal Strength with Link Anchor State</h4>In
the above approach, the strength of the signal at the device (for
example) can be modelled as a state of child node (anchor) that links
to the signal (see state sections above). For example, there may be a
family of signal "receipt" controls representing different strengths or
a child node and child value modelling strength (like a field).<h4>Signal Coverage as Linking</h4><p>A
partial solution to expressing signal coverage is to add controls to
the spaces in which the signal is (or may be) available which link in
turn to the signal.</p><p><img style="width: 382px; height: 178px;" alt="" src="images/signal_coverage_link.PNG"></p><p>The above state may then drive a reaction linking the device to the signal (and vice versa):</p><p><img style="width: 378px; height: 180px;" alt="" src="images/signal_coverage_and_connection_link.PNG"></p><p>If
the modelled space can be further subdivided then the signal coverage
can be more accurately defined (this is the dual of the asymmetric
overlap model above).&nbsp;</p><p><img style="width: 372px; height: 210px;" alt="" src="images/signal_coverage_link_and_region.PNG"></p><p>Otherwise
the coverage indicated in this way will be at best approximate, and
additional modelling will be needed (e.g. strength as link anchor
state).&nbsp; </p><h2>References</h2>
