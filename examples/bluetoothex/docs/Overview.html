<h1>Bluetoothex Example Bigraphspace Application</h1>
Chris Greenhalgh, 2009-08-27<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Bluetoothex
is an example application developed using bigraphspace, in fact it is
arguably the first application (excluding BigEd, the Eclipse plug-in).</p>
<p>This
application is based on a simple ubicomp scenario that has been used in
previous discussions of bigraphs: a mobile user with a hand-held device
is presented with document(s) appropriate to their current location as
they move around some site of interest (such as a museum).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The
technical basis assumed is the use of bluetooth "beacons" (i.e.
discoverable bluetooth devices) placed physically within the site of
interest, each of which is associated with a locally relevant document;
the mobile device periodically scans for beacons and displays the
corresponding document to the user.</p>
<h2>Bigraphspace implementation</h2>
<h3>Initialisation</h3>
<p>The application would be run on the mobile device. It begins by loading the following bigraph (from <a href="../etc/initialcontent.btl">etc/initialcontent.btl</a>):</p>
<pre>bigraph<br>	BigraphSpaceScreen <br>|	BigraphSpaceBluetooth <br>|	BigraphSpaceAuthored (<br>		DescriptionRoom (<br>			DescriptionBluetooth (<br>				BluetoothAddress ( "00:1c:9a:ed:54:29":string )<br>			)<br>		|	DigitalDocument (<br>				Filename ( "http://www.mrl.nott.ac.uk/~cmg":string )<br>			)<br>		)<br>	)			<br></pre>
<p><img style="width: 602px; height: 375px;" alt="" src="images/initial_bigraph.PNG"></p>
<p>The three top level nodes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BigraphSpaceScreen - which represents the screen buffer;</li>
  <li>BigraphSpaceBluetooth - which represents the internally published reports of observed bluetooth beacons; and</li>
  <li>BigraphSpaceAuthored - which represents the authored configuration downloaded onto the device.</li>
</ul>
<p>In
this example, there is one configured region of interest, the single
DescriptionRoom node in the BigraphSpaceAuthored node. It contains -
and therefore associates - the bluetooth beacon with bluetooth address
"00:1c:9a:ed:54:29" and the document with URL
"http://www.mrl.nott.ac.uk/~cmg".</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The application
has a timer thread which periodically (every 15 seconds) does a
bluetooth hardware scan using its local bluetooth radio (a low-level
I/O operation). Each time this thread runs it clears any previous
content of the BigraphSpaceBluetooth node and inserts into the
now-empty node a DescriptionBluetooth node (like the one in
BigraphSpaceAuthored) for every observed bluetooth beacon.</p>
<p>This
activity cannot be precisely represented using a standard bigraph
reaction rule in the case of multiple beacons in range (because it
simultaneously creates DescriptionBluetooth for every observed beacon.
If only one beacon is in range then it corresponds to a reaction such
as:</p>
<pre>bigraph BigraphSpaceBluetooth ( [1] ) =&gt;<br>bigraph BigraphSpaceBluetooth (	DescriptionBluetooth ( BluetoothAddress ( "00:1c:9a:ed:54:29":string ) ) )<br></pre>
<img style="width: 580px; height: 184px;" alt="" src="images/bluetooth_beacon_reaction.PNG">
<h3>Response</h3>
<p>The "behaviour" of the application is represented by one reaction rule with a bigraph expression as its redex:</p>
<pre>bigraph<br>// a detected bluetooth radio...<br>	BigraphSpaceBluetooth( [1] <br>	| 	DescriptionBluetooth ( BluetoothAddress ( $address:string ) )<br>	)<br>// leave authoring unchanged<br>||	BigraphSpaceAuthored( [2]<br>	|	DescriptionRoom( <br>			DescriptionBluetooth ( BluetoothAddress ( $address:string ) )<br>		|	DigitalDocument ( [3] )<br>		)<br>	)<br>// a screen...<br>||	BigraphSpaceScreen( [4] )<br>// variables...<br>where	$address:string<br><img style="width: 602px; height: 410px;" alt="" src="images/behaviour_redex.PNG"><br></pre>
<p>Note
the use of the index variable $address which allows the redex to match
any bluetooth address, provided that the same address is present both
in the bluetooth beacon report (in BigraphSpaceBluetooth) and&nbsp;in
the authored configuration.</p>
<p>The site [1] allows the rule to fire
even if other beacons are also in sight; the site [2] allows the rule
to fire if other rooms are also configured; the site [3] abstracts over
the internal structure of the document to be displayed; the site [4]
"captures" the current content of the screen.</p>
<p>So this rule will fire if the bluetooth beacon
code places a DescriptionBluetooth into the BigraphSpaceBluetooth with
the same bluetooth address as one in the authored configuration,
provided that in the authored configuration it is also associated with
a document (by common nesting within a DescriptionRoom).</p>
<p>The reactum - also parameterised in $address, as bound by the redex - is as follows:</p>
<pre>bigraph<br>// remove detected bluetooth radio...<br>	BigraphSpaceBluetooth( [1] )<br>// leave authoring unchanged<br>||	BigraphSpaceAuthored( [2]<br>	|	DescriptionRoom( <br>			DescriptionBluetooth ( BluetoothAddress ( $address:string ) )<br>		|	DigitalDocument ( [3] )<br>		)<br>	)<br>// update screen<br>||	BigraphSpaceScreen( <br>		DigitalDocument ( [3] ) <br>	)<br>where $address:string<br></pre>
<img style="width: 604px; height: 407px;" alt="" src="images/behaviour_reactum.PNG">
<p>Note
that the internal structure of the document (its filename, in this
case) is copied from the authored description into the
BigraphSpaceScreen, replacing any previous things on the screen.</p>
<p>Note
also that the bluetooth beacon report is removed from the
BigraphSpaceBluetooth, suppressing further firing of this rule until or
unless the bluetooth input process runs again.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Finally,
the application has a further reaction rule and associated event
listener to handle displaying documents on the actual device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;reaction rule (expression) is as follows:</p>
<pre>bigraph BigraphSpaceScreen( [1] | DigitalDocument ( Filename ( $filename:string ) ) )<br>where $filename:string<br></pre>
<p>=&gt;</p>
<pre>bigraph BigraphSpaceScreen( [1] )<br>where $filename:string<br></pre>
<img style="width: 575px; height: 228px;" alt="" src="images/display_reaction.PNG">
<p>I.e. one DigitalDocument (which in this case must have a Filename "field") is removed from the BigraphScreenSpace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The
program event listener which fires when this reaction occurs attempts
to load the specified file as a URL on the device screen:</p>
<p><img style="width: 425px; height: 332px;" alt="" src="images/bluetoothex_screenshot.PNG"></p>
<h3> Additional Behaviour Notes</h3>
<p>This
is the first time I have really used the indexed controls (for
strings), to avoid the use of constant links, and I think it works OK
(conceptually it is preferable IMO).</p>
<p>Because the application
scans for bluetooth beacons repeatedly, and replaces the
DescriptionBluetooth nodes each time, the application will re-display
the document each time the beacon is scanned in range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It
is hard - but interesting - to try to work out how other temporal
behaviours could be implemented and modelled, e.g. show only the first
time, show on first observation after a gap.</p>
<p>If several beacons
are observed at the same time which have associated documents then
those documents will be displayed rapidly in an arbitrary order each
time the bluetooth scanning activity runs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, it is
hard - but interesting - to try and work out how other strategies could
be implemented and modelled, both at the level of pure bigraphs, and
with the addition of higher-level constructs or constraints.</p>
<h2>Building and running</h2>
<p>The
build uses ANT. It currently assumes that bigraphspace.jar has been
built already (in ../../bigraphspace/dist, using "ant jar" in the
bigraphspace directory).</p>
<p>The test is run with "ant test".&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bluetooth scanning is a rather old Win32-specific
implementation; source and build file included (for Visual C++), but
with no warranty.</p>
<h3>Initial Reflections</h3>
<p>The programmatic API for building bigraphs
is rather verbose, long-winded and not fully implemented (watch out for
"unimplemented" exceptions when you run your application).&nbsp;</p>
